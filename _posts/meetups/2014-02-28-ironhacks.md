YH: Iron Hacks is a hackathon meant to bring together high schoolers who are interested in a day of coding, learning and collaboration to make something awesome. Participants in our high school hackathon can use any language and any hardware components they'd like to bring their ideas to life. We will have mentors and workshops to help students new to coding both learn and make something cool!

Registration is open here:
